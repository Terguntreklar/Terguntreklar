### Hi there 👋

My name is Aly, I'm from Cairo, Egypt, I'm a CompSci Student at the moment

#### Featured Projects

##### [Chat-Room](https://github.com/Terguntreklar/chat-room): 
A very simple website built using ReactJS and firebase, the website allows users to join anonymously and view the last 50 messages

##### [Etch-a-Sketch](https://github.com/Terguntreklar/Tergunreklar.Etch-A-Sketch.github.io): 
Very simple site (which works only on devices with a mouse pointer) the site works like a sketch, when your pointer passes over a grid element, the cell gets 10% darker, which is an excercise in DOM manipulation from [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

And hopefully, more soon!
